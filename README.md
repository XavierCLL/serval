# Serval

Serval is a QGIS plugin with raster editing tools.

Users can apply modifications to selected parts of a raster. 
It features setting a constant value (also NoData), an expression (probing rasters and interpolation on vector and mesh layers) and applying 3x3 low-pass filter. Multiband rasters are now fully supported with an option to operate on a single band.


**Warning**: Any changes of a raster cell value are immediately written to disk. Make a copy of your precious raster.
