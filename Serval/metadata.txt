description=Map tool for manipulating raster cell values.
version=3.0.1
author=Radoslaw Pasiok for Lutra Consulting Ltd.
email=radek.pasiok@lutraconsulting.co.uk

about=Usage: The tool has 3 modes: probing, drawing and erasing. In the probing mode cell values are read and can be changed manually in a spinbox. In drawing mode, chosen band values are set to a raster cell and immediately written to disk. Erasing is setting a raster cell value to NoData. For 3 bands rasters, native QGIS color picker can be used to define bands values.
Warning: All changes are immediately written to disk. Always keep backup of your original raster!
